      <p class="text-muted" >The ambience is related to the google. The painting on the wall tells us how some of the food were invented.
        They serve protien shakes, french fries, burgers, sandwiches, nuggets, and all kinds of milkshakes. Not only there food is amazing but
        also the way they serve it in nice good-looking plates are also impressive. the servers are very kind and patient. They serve large amount 
        dishes which can be shared by 2 people. The sign baord is pretty huge so when you come around the main road, you will be able to recognize it.

      <p class="text-muted" >Maldives is an island. Acoording to me it is the best place you can visit in the summer. The capital of Maldives is Male.
        There are many other islands as well, but there active valcanoes in the most of them. Hence, Ther are many resorts in Male comparing to the 
        other islands. I stayed in one of them. It was a world-class experience. If you are planning to visit there, you may wanna exchange ruppes into 
        dollars as dollars are the currency used in Maldives. There were many water games. I tried gocarting and jetski.Each sports game was 8 dollars. 
        It was very fun. The food was mostly western but there were also a few indian dishes. there were two types of houses where you can stay in,
        Water villa & Land Villa. Water villas are those where the villa is on the water whereas, land villa is where the villa is on the land!! I 
        lived on the land villa where I got the beach view. There were not only water games but also outdoor games like Squash, Billiards, Table Tennis
        and so on. And of caurse ther was a swimming pool which was big enough for everyong on the island to fit in!! Hence, Maldives is a place that 
        you must visit at least once in your lifetime.

         <p>The film tells the story of Count Dracula, the owner of the titular Hotel Transylvania where 
          the world's monsters can take a rest from human civilization. Dracula invites some of the most famous monsters to 
          celebrate the 118th birthday of his beloved daughter Mavis. This is the story about hotel transylvania 1, there are
          three other parts so, four parts in total. According to me, all these movies are my favourite and will be and are 
          amazing.</p>

          <p>Red Notice is a 2021 American action comedy film written, directed, and produced by Rawson Marshall 
            Thurber. Dwayne Johnson, who also served as a producer, stars as an FBI agent who reluctantly teams up with a 
            renowned art thief (Ryan Reynolds) in order to catch an even more notorious criminal (Gal Gadot). This film is filled
            with twists, actional and amazing sense of humour. I recommend you this movie as it contains all genres and is the 
            best you can find!!!</p>
